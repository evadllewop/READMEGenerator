  # README Generator

  ## Description
  This project is a command-line application that will prompt the user with a series of questions and based on those answers, dynamically generate a README Markdown file describing your project and give instructions on how to use it.

  ## Installation
  To be able to run this application, the user will need to run `npm install` in order to install any dependencies that are in the package.json file. In this case the `inquirer` package needs to be installed. This prompts the user from the command-line a series of questions and takes user input data. Then to run the application, use `node index.js`.

  ## Usage
  Once the user installs all dependencies and runs the application with `node index.js`, they will answer some questions about the project and then based on their answers, the README file will be generated.

  ## Credits
  I was able to get a pretty good start due to reading the `inquirer` package documentation that was available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#installation. I also would like to give credit to my tutor Andrew Knowles https://github.com/jaknowles97. He was extremely helpful.
